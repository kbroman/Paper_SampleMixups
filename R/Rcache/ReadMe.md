This directory contains just one cached file, `n_bad_hypo.RData`,
which contains just one object, which just contains one number (the
number of bad hypo arrays).

The file is produced by
[`samplemixups_nolegends.Rnw`](https://github.com/kbroman/Paper_SampleMixups/blob/master/samplemixups_nolegends.Rnw#L421-L430)
The cached file is to save time in calculating the number when
compiling the paper.
