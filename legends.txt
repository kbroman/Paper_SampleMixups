>KWB_FIG1_LEGEND
  Scheme for evaluating the similarity between expression
  arrays for different tissues.  We first consider the expression of
  each array probe for samples assayed for both tissues (A) and calculate
  the between-tissue correlation in expression (B).  We identify the
  subset of array probes with correlation $>$ 0.75 (shaded region in C)
  and calculate the correlation in gene expression for one sample in
  the first tissue and another sample in the second tissue, across
  these selected probes.  This forms a similarity matrix (D), for which
  darker squares indicate greater similarity.  Orange
  squares indicate missing values (samples assayed in one tissue
  but not the other).

>KWB_FIG2_LEGEND
  Scheme for evaluating the similarity between genotypes and expression
  arrays.  We first identify a set of probes with
  strong local eQTL.  For each such eQTL, we use the samples with both
  genotype and expression data (A) to form a classifier for predicting
  eQTL genotype from the expression value (B).  We then compare the
  observed eQTL genotypes for one sample to the inferred eQTL
  genotypes, from the classifiers, for another sample (C).  The
  proportion of matches, between the observed and inferred genotypes,
  forms a similarity matrix (D), for which darker squares indicate
  greater similarity.  Orange squares indicate missing values (for
  example, samples with genotype data but no expression data).

  Self similarity (median correlation across tissue pairs) versus
  maximum similarity for the expression arrays for each tissue.  The
  diagonal gray line corresponds to equality.  Green points are
  inferred to be sample mix-ups. Gray points correspond to arrays for
  which the self similarity is maximal.  Red points correspond to
  special cases (see the text).  There were
  27~samples assayed only for kidney; these have
  missing self similarity values.

>KWB_FIG4_LEGEND
  The mRNA sample mix-ups for the six tissues.  Double-headed arrows
  indicate a sample swap.  The trio of points in adipose corresponds
  to a three-way swap.  The pink circles with a single-headed arrow,
  in islet and liver, are sample duplicates.  The questionable case in
  kidney indicates a potential sample mixture arrayed twice.

>KWB_FIG5_LEGEND
  Plot of islet expression vs observed genotype for an example
  probe.  Points are colored by the inferred genotype, based on a
  k-nearest neighbor classifier, with yellow, green, and blue
  corresponding to BB, BR, and RR, respectively, where B = B6 and R =
  BTBR.  Salmon-colored points lie at the boundary between two
  clusters and were not assigned.
<

>KWB_FIG6_LEGEND
  Self similarity (proportion matches between observed and
  inferred eQTL genotypes, combined across tissues) versus maximum
  similarity for the DNA samples.  The diagonal gray line corresponds to
  equality.  Samples with missing self similarity (at bottom) were not
  intended to have expression assays performed.  Gray points
  correspond to DNA samples that were correctly labeled.  Green points
  correspond to sample mix-ups that are fixable (the correct label can
  be determined).  Red points comprise both samples mix-ups that
  cannot be corrected as well as samples that may be correct but
  cannot be verified as no expression data is
  available.
<

>KWB_FIG7_LEGEND
  The DNA sample mix-ups on the seven 96-well plates used for
  genotyping.  Black dots indicate that the correct DNA was put in the
  well.  Blue arrows point from where a sample should have been placed to
  where it was actually placed; the different shades of blue convey no
  meaning.  Red X's indicate DNA samples that were omitted.  Orange
  arrowheads indicate wells with incorrect samples, but the sample
  placed there is of unknown origin.  Purple and green arrow-heads
  indicate cases where the sample placed in the well was incorrect,
  but the DNA that was supposed to be there was not found; with the
  purple cases, there was corresponding gene expression data, while
  for the green cases, there was no corresponding gene expression
  data.  Pink circles (e.g., well D02 on plate 1631) indicate sample
  duplicates.  Gray dots indicate that the sample placed in the well
  cannot be verified, as there was no corresponding gene expression
  data.  Gray circles indicate controls or unused wells.

The behavior of the X chromosome
in the intercross (BTBR $\times$ B6) $\times$ (BTBR $\times$ B6).  In
the F$_2$ generation, females are homozygous BTBR or heterozygous,
while males are hemizygous BTBR or B6.  The small bar is the Y
chromosome.

>KWB_FIGS2_LEGEND
X chromosome genotypes for
19~female mice and 17~male mice with genotypes that are incompatible
with their sex.  Females should be homozygous BTBR (RR, blue) or
heterozygous (green).  Males should be hemizygous B6 (BY, yellow) or
hemizygous BTBR (RY, blue).  The top four males have a single
incompatibility that could reasonably be a genotyping error.

Self similarity (proportion matches between observed and
  inferred eQTL genotypes, considering each tissue separately) versus
  maximum similarity for the DNA samples.  The diagonal gray line
  corresponds to equality.  Samples with missing self similarity (at
  top) did not have an expression assay performed for that tissue.
